# uni-sql-queries
Uploading all the SQL queries from my university classes because I want to get rid of Java in my Most Used Languages statistics that badly.

Semester ~~1~~2 (my bad)  queries are for MySQL, semester 3 & 5 are for ~~my dreadful slow-paced SQL query typing classes with the same unfortunate professor pick~~ MS SQL Server & T-SQL
